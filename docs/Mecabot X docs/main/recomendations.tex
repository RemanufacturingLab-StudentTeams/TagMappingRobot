\section{Recommendations}
To improve the use of the Mecabot X these recommendations can be implemented in the future.

\subsection{Map argument Nav2}

Currently the nav2 function ignores the \texttt{maps :=} argument. So you need to hardcode the map name and location when using this function. The usability can be improved if this argument would work.

\subsection{LiDAR filter variables}

Currently you need the set the blind spots inside the .cpp file. This means you need to recompile every time you change this variable. This could be mediated by creating a config file that is read by the program.

\subsection{LiDAR rotation}

The software has the LiDAR rotated 180 degrees from the front. If this is changed the physical LiDAR can be rotated to the correct orientation.
