\section{Setup}\label{sec:setup}
This section will show how to connect with the Mecabot X and use the ROS 2 commands. For this section you need a working version of Ubuntu 22.04 with ROS 2 Humble installed. Appendix \ref{sec:appendix_setup} shows how to install Ubuntu and setup ROS 2.

%TODO: Copy prefious info.

\subsection{Connecting to the Mecabot}
Currently the Mecabot is connected to the ''iotroam'' network. Your PC needs to be connected to the same network and you need to find the IP of the Mecabot.

\subsubsection{Mecabot on iotroam}

Finding the IP can be done using ''Angry IP Scanner''\cite{IPScanner}. Figure \ref{fig:ip_scanner} show the interface of the IP scanner. All the IPs with a blue dot are active IPs that can be connected to.

	\caption{Example of Angry Ip Scanner window}
	\label{fig:ip_scanner}
\end{figure}

If you're connected to the correct WI-FI network then the ''IP Range:'' should be filled in automaticity. The range for ''iotroam'' should be from \texttt{10.35.4.0} to \texttt{10.35.4.255}.

Currently the IP of the Mecabot X is: \texttt{10.35.4.17}, but this can change over time.

\subsubsection{Mecabot on own network}
If the Mecabot X can't find a WI-FI network that it previously has connected to. It will create it's own WI-FI network called ''\texttt{WHEELTEC\_ORINNX\_humble}''.

You can connect to this network using the default password ''\texttt{dongguan}''.\\
\textbf{Note: If you connect to the Mecabot hotspot you won't have internet on you laptop.} \\

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{./pictures/mecabot_wifi_win.jpg}
\end{figure}

When connected using the hotspot the default IP is: \texttt{192.168.0.100}.

\subsubsection{Using SSH}
When connected on the same network you can use SSH to connect to the Meacabot X. The password is: ''\texttt{dongguan}''.

\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{minted}{bash}
ssh wheeltec@192.168.0.100
\end{minted}
\end{tcolorbox}

The ip ''\texttt{192.168.0.100}'' should be the IP of the Mecabot.

Appendix \ref{sec:appendix_add_ssh} shows how to add your SSH key to the Mecabot. This makes it so you don't need to constantly type in the password. Figure \ref{fig:ssh} shows the ssh connection.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{./pictures/ssh_connection.png}
	\caption{Terminal connected through SSH}
	\label{fig:ssh}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Run ROS}
When connected run the following command to see if ROS 2 is working.

\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{minted}{bash}
ros2 launch turn_on_wheeltec_robot turn_on_wheeltec_robot.launch.py
\end{minted}
\end{tcolorbox}

This will initialize the sensors in the Mecabot. If this commands fails or is not found it might mean source isn't used.
See appendix \ref{sec:appendix_compile} or \ref{sec:appendix_bashrc} for more info on how to resolve this.
